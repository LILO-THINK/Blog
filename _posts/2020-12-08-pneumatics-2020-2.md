We're keeping the tests with plastic bags, paper and air to create some kind of flora. We did more iron soldering with the plastic bag, but this time with the supervision of the master Ricardo Bizafra. He taught how to patches the holes with more plastic! At the end we tried the soldering process with the laser cutter, but out of focus... I also tested  a thermoplastic that Adriana Cabrera gave to me. Interesting results...
