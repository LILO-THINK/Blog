## Galaxy, a micro-universe in expansion, is an installation of dynamic lights that intends to present the immersive universe of microbiology

This prototype was a partnership with Guilherme Bullejos ðŸ«€

One of the explanations of the biodiversity of the world starts with the idea od complex systems. There are countless elements and groups which make not possible to define explicitly the casual relation between every element or group. However, these systems have simple rules which allow the spountaneous revealing of their emerging characteristics.

The evolving theory points to the primordial soup which had given origin to a nitrogenous basis and single-cell organisms at a certain point. As a serendipity choreography, some of those single-cell organisms gave origin to life. Galaxy is an entertaining and optimismtic installation that intends to highlight the force and intelligence that biology can offer when its elements decide to contribute and work together.

#### Public Experience

**In this entertaining installation, the visitors are involved by the effect of lighting changing the space's perception.**

The visitors are invited to immerse in this space and experience the dynamicity of the microbiology universe by the changing of scale and perspective of the intern representation of its complex systems. The game of lights and shadow populate the space transforming it in a 3d representation of the microbiology universe dynamic.

The spectacle of the moving lights around the whole installation brings to the visitorsâ€™ reflections about the processes that allowed all beings to be alive and evolve.

#### Schedule
##### **PROTOTYPE 1:2**
A metal structure with DMX protocol
MAY 2020

The second prototype in the 1: 2 scale will be responsible for directing many important decisions. First, regarding the light source and communication protocol. The prototype will be made with 18 CAN64 DMX RGBW reflectors, but we are studying the possibility of making our own reflectors to have control of consumption / power and lenses to direct the objective of the effect we intend to achieve. Another point is the structure, we like the idea of working with treated metal and in general, in Brazil, we use a lot of material for reusing event scenography. The idea is to reuse metals from previous installations. About what we are called a filter, which will help in the effects, we are thinking about using recycled plastic. Thus, we were able to create a moisture resistant module.

###### FINAL PIECE PRODUCTION
China
AGO 2020

There is a possibility to produce the electronic part of the final part with our suppliers in China. Case that needs to be studied even during the tests of the 1: 2 prototype. The production of the filter made from recycled plastic will be done in Brazil, but the metal structure can be made locally.

###### PRESENTATION
Maybe at some Light Festival...
NOV 2020

It is necessary to study the assembly schedule and start in advance given the dimension of the part (6 meters !!). It is also necessary to provide a time for testing the stress of the final piece ready and running a few days before the Festival. Then, it just opens the champagne !!
