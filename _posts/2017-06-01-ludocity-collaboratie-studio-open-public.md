This project was delivered with the partnership of Amanda Almeida, Giovanna Casimiro, Washie Pichinin, Anielle Guedes, Fernanda Tosta e Garoa Hacker Clube ðŸ«€

**LudoCity** is a shared studio open to the public. In this space, artists and the public come together through digital fabrication and creativity to collaboratively create art and design objects. Over time, this shared experience aims to build an interactive structure or installation using innovative materials that reflect new applications in architecture, such as concrete, wood, LEDs, circuits, and more. To achieve this, the activities will focus on handling various materials towards the final goal.

In the first edition of the **LudoCity** studio, we brought together various spaces and professionals specializing in rethinking space, city, and technology through collaborative processes. Participants included:

- **LILO.Zone**: A shared studio for creative technology use.
- **Fernanda Tosta**: A woodworking instructor.
- **Garoa Hacker Club**: An open space for electronics enthusiasts.
- **Urban 3D**: A startup focused on 3D printing houses in concrete.

### How It Works

The first edition spanned two days and featured activities divided into two categories:

- **Open Immersion**: From 10 AM to 3 PM, this period was dedicated to showcasing projects, machinery, and techniques from the studio groups.
- **Collaborative Workshops**: From 3 PM to 6 PM, professionals led activities aimed at creating a final project, which was displayed in the center of the studio. These activities were conducted by different resident spaces and were interconnected, as the final objective was to construct an installation involving innovative materials, design, creative collaboration, and interactivity.
