## My First Steps into the Futurium

I had often heard friends and colleagues rave about the [Futurium](https://futurium.de/en) in Berlin â€” a center dedicated to exploring and discussing future possibilities. As someone who has always been a bit skeptical about futurism and futurology, I approached the idea of visiting with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. While the concept of future design intrigued me, my reservations stemmed from the feeling that much of it revolves around finding solutions for future problems, often tinged with apocalyptic undertones.

However, the Futuriumâ€™s reputation as a place for speculation and open-minded exploration of the future piqued my interest. It seemed like one of the few fields where people feel free to imagine and dream. So, I decided to visit the Futurium with an open heart and mind, ready to see what this unique place had to offer.

My first surprise was learning about the extensive collaboration behind the Futurium. It was born from the combined efforts of various scientific institutions, businesses, and the German government. This initiative brought together academic research groups, industry leaders, and governmental bodies â€” all united by a common goal: to speculate about and design the future. This level of cooperation highlighted the widespread interest in futurism across different sectors, reinforcing the importance of this speculative endeavor.

Unlike typical museum exhibitions, the Futurium is a standalone building entirely dedicated to future design (The other one I visited was "Museu do AmanhÃ£" in Rio de Janeiro). This dedication made the experience all the more intriguing, as it signified a serious commitment to exploring future possibilities in a comprehensive manner.


As I entered the Futurium, I found the exhibition divided into three main areas: Human, Nature, and Technology. Despite my initial expectations of a larger exhibition, I appreciated the focused and well-organized approach. Each section delved into different aspects of our future, offering a distinct perspective on how we might live, interact with our environment, and leverage technological advancements.

## Nature: A Thought-Provoking Encounter

Among the three areas, the Nature section particularly captivated me. It explored the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world, emphasizing sustainability and environmental stewardship.

The exhibits showcased various innovative ideas and approaches to preserving biodiversity, combating climate change, and managing natural resources sustainably. Personally, my highlights are from this area of the exhibition.

## My Highlights

### Biocomposite Bricks: A New Era in Construction

One of exhibits in the Nature section was related to the use of mycelium-based biocomposites for construction. I have been following the development of this technology since 2018 and was thrilled to see one more tangible example at the Futurium. 

This biocomposite material, derived from mycelium, offers a sustainable alternative to traditional building materials. The rigid structure and geometric innovative application as a construction material, potentially a "new brick," were particularly impressive. Although I forgot to note the name of the research group behind this project, I captured some photos and a video to document this.

### Flushed: Revolutionizing Waste Treatment with Fungi

Another standout project in the Nature section was called Flushed. This innovative concept involves a type of toilet paper embedded with dried mushroom spores. These spores become active when exposed to water and can help break down pharmaceutical residues found in wastewater. This solution addresses a significant environmental issue: the contamination of water bodies by medications excreted by humans.

According to Eduardo Padilha (my favorite scientist and another author in this blog) substances like caffeine are major pollutants in our residual water system. Flushed aims to mitigate this problem by using fungi to digest these residues, potentially cleaning the wastewater more effectively. The designer, Sofia ReiÃŸenweber, has created a product that not only serves its primary function but also contributes to environmental sustainability. This concept is intriguing, and I am eager to see how it develops, especially since it might soon enter the market.

The Flushed project exemplifies how creative and unexpected solutions can address complex environmental issues. By leveraging the natural properties of fungi, this project offers a novel way to manage pharmaceutical waste, a growing concern in many parts of the world. I have to say, I'm curious about how safe this paper toilet is in contact with the intimate parts ðŸ‘€

### The Intriguing World of Soil Bacteria

For me, the most interesting in the Nature section of the Futurium was the [Biotricity Bacteria Battery](https://smitesmits.com/Biotricity.html) from - [Rasa Smite & Raitis Smits](https://smitesmits.com/index.html). This project delves into the fascinating possibility of extracting energy from soil bacteria. My interest in this innovative concept was piqued back in 2019 when I first encountered similar research by the LABIC team in Costa Rica. More recently, I have been following the work of [Miranda Moss](https://mirandamoss.com/), who has been exploring these alternative energy sources with a fresh perspective.

The Biotricity Bacteria Battery project exemplifies the synergy between art, science, and technology. Initially conceived as a blend of artistic expression and scientific inquiry, it aims to inspire and hypothesize rather than develop a market-ready product. The project taps into the ability of soil bacteria found in mud to generate electricity, showcasing how energy can be harvested from natural, often overlooked sources.

### The Role of Art and Science

Smite and Smitsâ€™s work illustrates the importance of speculative projects in pushing the boundaries of what we consider possible. While more practical projects like the Flushed toilet paper and mycelium biocomposites focus on product development, Biotricity invites us to imagine a world where we can power everyday objects, such as clocks, using the energy generated by bacteria in the soil. This approach blurs the lines between art, design, and science, fostering a creative environment where new ideas can flourish.

The potential of soil bacteria to produce energy by these artists has been explored since around 2014, but it remains a cutting-edge field with much to discover. The Biotricity project embodies this experimental spirit, demonstrating that our future energy solutions might come from the most unexpected places: from the mud! **If God created humans from clay, the are the humans able to create light from mud?**

## Reflecting on the Futurium: A Space Dedicated to Future Design
