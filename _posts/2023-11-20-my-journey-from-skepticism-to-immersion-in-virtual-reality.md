## My Journey from Skepticism to Immersion in Virtual Reality

Back in 2016, I recall sharing my skepticism about VR with [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAApTjaMBJ6apIBkQyUIm-eFGqnF3rMXAdB0)[Dr. Giovanna Graziosi Casimiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggcasimiro/), a mixed-reality visionary even then. "What's the fun in a virtual world if it's a solitary journey?" I questioned. However, this weekend's experience at Fusion Arena in Zurich (from [Pandally AG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pandally-ag/)) completely transformed my perspective.

In a unique twist on escape room adventures, our group of four engaged in a compelling narrative, each equipped with headsets, headphones, and hand and foot trackers. This technology didn't just allow us to navigate the virtual realm; it enabled us to see and interact with each other—exchanging high fives, passing torches, and collaboratively building bridges. Remarkably, the technical gear faded into the background, creating a seamless and immersive experience.

This wasn't a sudden leap from my initial VR encounter. Over the years, thanks to Paulo Muggler—a seasoned VR developer and researcher focused on integrating haptic sensors in training environments—I've witnessed the evolution of VR. From various headset generations to advancements in graphics and spatial tracking, the journey has been extraordinary. But this latest experience stood out, marking my first fully immersive, story-driven adventure with friends.

Inspired by this, I am now driven to create similar experiences. Leveraging the power of expanded cinema, I envision crafting narratives that transcend traditional boundaries, offering unparalleled immersion and interaction.

I finally understand the fascination around VR and the new era in storytelling! How can we leverage VR's capabilities to redefine narrative experiences? Let's brainstorm and collaborate to push the boundaries of storytelling, merging the virtual with the real. I challenge you, my fellow innovators and technophiles, to explore the potential of mixed reality. Your thoughts and ideas are awaited!
