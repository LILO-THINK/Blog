## What is better than one bio 3D printer? Of course, it's two bio 3Ds! Or maybe three...

[[Tauan Bernardo]] got excited about bio3D printing and started a study group at Rog Center to create a community around, so if you are close to Ljubljana - Slovenia go to check in person [Bio3DPrinter](https://www.center-rog.si/en/programme/bio3dprinter/)

But if you are like me, with a small maker space at home and assembling your own bio3D printer, join us online. Everything you need is a regular 3D printer that you can hack. I'm using a Prusa frame cut by [[Laure Stelmastchuk]] in inox! ðŸ˜±

#### What is the Rog Center?

The Rog Center is a vibrant creative hub in Ljubljana, where imagination and craftsmanship collide. It's packed with nine production labs featuring tools from traditional to high-tech, available for members to explore. Sounds that there, designers, engineers, chefs, and artisans come together to transform ideas into tangible creations. The center also boasts a marketplace with local products, project studios, and free drop-in corners. With workshops, guided courses, and a bustling community spirit, Rog Center is the perfect place for creative minds to innovate and collaborate.

I hope to know the place in person very soon.
