## Paper Memories | **VIDEOMAPPING + HANDCRAFT**

This prototype was a partnership with [Mari Nagem](https://marinagem.com/) ðŸ«€

Paper Memories goes from the architectural process, passing through an archiving and writing practice until the digital ways of creating poetry. It keeps memory alive with a video mapping craft experience.

Narratives, optical effects and representations of a perspective, are all illusions. The mapping experience is a way to explore these elements combined. Normally using digital animation and effects, we forgot that all those elements were explored in the beginning of the cinema and animation, with a lot of manual work. These same hands, are the ones writing the scripts, and the ones drawing and projecting spaces.

Our proposal is to explore the hybridity ways of producing moving image, combining paper cut, filming and digital effects to render an homage to paper, architecture and history.

## Presentation of Development | Collage

Our 30s video is a sample of tests we did to understand how to mix the following techniques: paper cut stop motion, filmed image, digital collage and animation with touches of silent movie effects. It is a pinch of some moments present in the narrative, a sketch. All the images will be re-filmed and re-made with the necessary adjustments for the final projection.

The soundtrack is a collage of 2 pianos works from Beethoven with some sound effects. It will be develop to become one entire piece with different rhythms and electronic interferences along the dramaturgy.
