### A Passion for Theatre and Technology

Since the age of nine, theatre has been my greatest passion—a love at first sight. The stage, the live performance, the immediacy of it all captivated me deeply. Many people may not know this, but my fascination with theatre led me to explore various intersections between performance and technology.

In 2012, while working with the collective DMV22 on technical direction, I tried to integrate my passions into one cohesive practice. During this period, I encountered the incredible live illustration work of artist [Achiles Luciano](https://www.achilesluciano.com/grafite-digital-ou-tagtool?lang=en), who used a tool called Tagtool.

My first brush with Tagtool was in 2010, but it was in 2012 that I began working with it regularly. Initially, Tagtool was a DIY hardware device requiring assembly. One had to procure potentiometers, connect them to an Arduino, and use a digital drawing tablet to create animations in real-time. This tool transformed simple illustrations into dynamic, stage-ready projections, adding a special dimension to live performances.

The real-time drawing and animation capabilities of Tagtool made it a perfect fit for theatrical performances. On stage, an artist could create illustrations that interacted with live dancers, as Achiles Luciano did with [Mario Lopes](https://mariolopesvs.com/). This synergy between live illustration and performance brought narratives to life in a unique and captivating way.

### From DIY to Digital: The Evolution of Tagtool

Since 2012, I hadn't engaged with Tagtool closely, observing from afar as groups like VJ Suave in São Paulo innovatively used it for city-wide performances. Initially, Tagtool was an open-source project created by the OMAi group, allowing anyone to build their own device. Despite the challenges of sourcing components like potentiometers and Arduino —especially difficult in Brazil at that time — the community embraced this innovative tool. Detailed assembly instructions were provided on platforms like Instructables, ensuring that even with these hurdles, the tool remained accessible.

The shift from a DIY hardware setup to an iPad app made Tagtool more accessible in a new way. Previously, assembling components, installing software, and troubleshooting were necessary, but now, the iPad app's intuitive interface and precise stylus capabilities revolutionized live animation, making it more user-friendly for theatre and performance artists. While the app must be purchased from the Apple Store, the integrated nature of the iPad, with its built-in touchscreen and stylus, maintained the tool's accessibility by eliminating the need for additional hardware.

This time, during a Homemade event (a geek Summer Camp in Switzerland), I finally tested the iPad version. Initially apprehensive about losing the hands-on assembly aspect, I soon appreciated the app's ease of use and accessibility, which opened new possibilities for live performance art.


### The Magic of Live Performance

Interestingly, the simplicity of Tagtool, centered around drawing, first captivated children at the summer camp, including my daughter. The kids eagerly used the iPad to create digital graffiti, projecting their art onto the lodge’s exterior wall after dark. This playful interaction introduced the children to animation and storytelling through a new medium.

Once the kids had their fun, the adults took over. [Chrysa Chouliara](https://kaascat.ch/), a science illustrator, and [Lívia Stöckli](https://www.instagram.com/djlivia/), a seasoned DJ, explored Tagtool's potential for live performance. Despite being an established tool, Tagtool’s transition to a digital app brought renewed interest and accessibility. 

This experience highlighted a fundamental truth: **the child within us all delights in seeing our creations come to life, whether on stage, in the streets, or at a summer camp**. The magic of a simple, accessible tool like Tagtool, with its long history and evolving form, continues to inspire and captivate artists and audiences alike. It's a testament to the enduring power of creativity and innovation in the realm of live performance art.
