## "Imagineering"... I learned this word today

During World War II, An aluminum company (Alcoa) created an internal "Imagineering" program to encourage innovative usage of aluminum in order to keep up with demand.  
  
The program said: "Imagineering is letting your imagination soar, and then engineering it down to earth".  
  
Maybe a way to say to the collaborators: reflecting on our previous work, we conclude that unless we innovate significantly, there's a possibility our customers won't approach us for similar projects in the future, so let's be creative!  
  
I think I'll change my job title on Linkedin, I'll put: imagineer.
