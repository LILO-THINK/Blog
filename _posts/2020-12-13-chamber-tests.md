We initially experimented with steam as our projection surface for this prototype. However, due to our system's small scale, we found using a theater smoke machine more effective to create a more immersive environment.

This idea was heavily embraced by our former partner, Luis Le√£o, known for being my partner in visual experimentation with videomapping and lights.

We got inspired to explore the possibility of creating an immersive cloud chamber (a particle detector used to visualize the passage of ions).

This technique, combined with generative projection on smoke and mirrors, allowed us to create a truly unique and engaging visual experience.
