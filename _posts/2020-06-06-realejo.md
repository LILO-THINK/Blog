This prototype is with the partnership of LÃ­dia Ganhito e Liana Yuri ðŸ«€

## The Exhibition

The exhibition features six lambe-lambe theater boxes (40 x 40 x 40 cm) arranged on different planes (floor, tripod, high, etc.), a small stage, and a cube with elastic walls. Each of these boxes allows viewers to see its content through a slit. The lambe-lambe theater boxes, the stage, and the elastic wall area are referred to as stations.

### Station 04

A small elevated stage (20 cm) stretches two meters along a wall. On the wall, small speakers are attached. Though silent, a projection mapped onto them displays images of silent sounds, onomatopoeias, commands, and old typography. A spotlight sits in the middle of the stage. Anyone attempting to step into the light will find it always turns off. Six school desks are placed in the audience area, provoking thoughts on the constant struggle to be heard and the oppression of being silenced in an information-overloaded world.

### Station 12

Next to a bed of nails, there is a mirrored box. Through its slit, one can observe a white feather floating with extreme lightness.

### Station 23

This theater features a crank that the viewer can turn to move a crowd. Is it a protest? A celebration?

### Station 34

Inside this lambe-lambe theater, a motorized mechanism creates an optical illusion. On one side is a cage, on the other, a key. The movement creates a paradox.

### Station 42

A typewriter inside the box never stops typing. A roll of paper feeds in and out, constantly rewriting and repeating, generating an excess of content and incomprehensible information.

### Station 63

A 2 x 2m cube with elastic walls forces the viewer to navigate the membrane to see inside. Inside, there is a slide projector showing images of doors, locks, and keys.

### Station 86

A body outline is marked on the floor. The viewer must position themselves within this outline to see inside the box. Inside, a knife constantly taps on a cell phone.

### Station 92

To view this scene, the viewer must stand on a bench and place their head inside the box, where they will see a family sitting on a couch watching them.

## Workshops

### Pop-Up Techniques Studio

This workshop focuses on creating three-dimensional forms from paper to make pop-up pages, exploring various techniques:

- On the first day, we will introduce the group, demonstrate related works, and practice two pop-up techniques: Origami and Kirigami, using simple tools to transform the material and explore its possibilities.
- On the second day, we will continue exploring techniques, share the previous day's works, and create a video featuring participant interactions and testimonials for the exhibition.

### Electronics for Artistic Creation

This workshop involves creating structures from paper, wire, and wooden sticks, with movements generated by motors and illuminated by LEDs:

- Handling and using a soldering iron;
- Creating electronic circuits with batteries, resistors, LEDs, buttons, motors, and speakers;
- Using a protoboard for circuit testing;
- Designing ways to integrate circuits into existing objects and materials such as paper (various weights) and wire.

## Discussion

### Art and Technology: What Can Technical Media Say About Creative Practice?

- An open conversation with the cultural center's education team and the general public to present study phases, research, aesthetic choices, and the conception and production process;
- Reflecting on the limitations and possibilities of creative work with technology and how art and technology pathways can contribute to our society.

### Performance: Realejo Remix

- The original film, in high-contrast shades, includes some scenes colored on the film stock. The digital reinterpretation will use binary information and machine language to stochastically reorganize new images. In the age of machine learning, what can a machine learn and teach about the context of Caligari?
- These computer-generated images will serve as the basis for video mapping within the exhibition space. Similarly, the audio track will be fragmented and recomposed by algorithms that gather and distort "Caligari" text recordings, creating a sound poem akin to another contemporary artistic practice of the film.
