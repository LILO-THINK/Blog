## A praline made of cheese - What are the odds?

Sometimes I THINK we need to re-design the food, I already had a chance to talk with [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABMszH8BtsfBgDQxUluu-SOmUJJcvz_WX00)[Fransisca Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fransiscatan/) about this. One of her skills is working with Food Experience Design. The production, preparation and also serving, and eating always intrigue me and I'm always happy to meet people able to give me new perspectives.  
  
Today, I encountered an entirely unexpected product: a praline made of cheese! This innovative creation is the work of [Osanna Lechner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osannanazaretyan/). When I asked her where the idea came from, she explained that she got inspired by a baker's school in Russia, where she lived before moving to Switzerland. Traditionally, I know a praline as a French sweet made with nuts, sugar, and cream, but I never imagined cheese in the recipe.

Now, I have the chance to try a French sweet recipe reimagined by Russians, made with Swiss cheese. I think this is the perfect product or souvenir to give my friends, representing my time in Switzerland.
