## Step 1: Installing Jekyll on Your Machine
### What You‚Äôll Need

- A terminal (command line interface)
- Ruby (the programming language Jekyll is built on)

### Step-by-step
1. **Check for Ruby Installation:** 
	Open your terminal and type:
	
	```
	ruby -v 
	``` 
	
	If Ruby isn‚Äôt installed, you‚Äôll need to install it. For macOS, you can use Homebrew: 
	
	```
	brew install ruby 
	```
	
	For Windows, use RubyInstaller: [Download RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/)

2. **Install Jekyll and Bundler:** 
	With Ruby installed, you can now install Jekyll and Bundler gems: 
	
	```
	gem install jekyll bundler 
	```

## Step 2: Setting Up Your Jekyll Portfolio
#### Creating a New Jekyll Site
1. **Create a new Jekyll site:** 
	
	```bash
	jekyll new my-portfolio cd my-portfolio
	```
	
2. **Install Dependencies:** 
	
	```bash
	bundle install
	```
	
3. **Run Your Site Locally:** 
	
	```bash
	bundle exec jekyll serve
	``` 
	
	Open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to see your site.

#### Configuring Your Portfolio 
1. **Markdown:** Use Markdown to write your content. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory with the following format:
	
	 ```markdown
	 ---
	 layout: post title: "My First Project" 
	 date: YYYY-MM-DD 
	 ---
	 
	 ## Project Title 
	 Description of your project. 
	 ```
	

2. **Structure:**
	- **_layouts:** Templates for your pages (e.g., default.html).
	- **_pages:** Individual pages (e.g., about.md).
	- **_posts:** Blog posts or project entries.
	- **_config.yml:** Your site‚Äôs configuration file.

### Step 3: Creating a GitHub Account and Repository

1. **Create a GitHub Account:** 
	If you don‚Äôt have one, sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. **Create a New Repository:**
    - Click on the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button on your GitHub dashboard.
    - Name your repository `<your-username>.github.io`.
    - Initialize with a README file.

### Step 4: Hosting Your Portfolio on GitHub Pages

1. **Push Your Site to GitHub:**
	
	```bash 
	git init 
	git add . 
	git commit -m "Initial commit" 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git 
	git branch -M main 
	git push -u origin main 
	```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    - Go to your repository‚Äôs settings.
    - Scroll down to the ‚ÄúGitHub Pages‚Äù section.
    - Under ‚ÄúSource,‚Äù select the `main` branch and click ‚ÄúSave.‚Äù

3. **Visit Your Site:** Your portfolio will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.
