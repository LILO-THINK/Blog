Este projeto é liderado por Lina Lopes, Nathan Rabinovitch e Recy Freire, autores de quatro livros sobre aprendizagem criativa publicados pela Faber-Castell no Brasil. Além de escreverem artigos, tutoriais e desenvolverem currículos, os autores têm vasta experiência em projetos mão na massa e que envolvem tecnologia e materiais. O projeto “A Infância de Gepetto” visa criar um livro infantil interativo que promove a aprendizagem criativa, explorando temas como invenção, tecnologia e materialidade. Utilizando ferramentas inovadoras como o Chat GPT, o projeto integra elementos de design thinking e storytelling para desenvolver personagens e histórias que estimulam a curiosidade e a criatividade dos leitores. Acompanhe nosso podcast e blog para seguir nossa jornada criativa e descobrir como estamos transformando ideias em realidade! *Sobre os autores: Lina Lopes, Nathan Rabinovitch e Recy Freire são especialistas em aprendizagem criativa, tendo colaborado em diversos projetos educacionais.

    "title": "From Junk to Funk, Making a Musical Junker Box with Sonic Pi and Vintage Phones",
    "body": "2024/08/01 - Sonic Pi: An Introduction: Sonic Pi is an open-source programming environment designed for creating live music performances. Developed by Dr. Sam Aaron at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, it has been in the market since 2014. Sonic Pi is built on top of SuperCollider, a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. The main goal of Sonic Pi is to introduce coding to a broader audience, particularly children, by making programming engaging and accessible through music. The software has gained significant traction in both educational and creative sectors. It is widely used in classrooms to teach the basics of programming and music composition, as well as by professional musicians and live coders who perform complex, real-time audio compositions. Sonic Pi’s intuitive interface and powerful capabilities make it an ideal tool for both beginners and experienced users. Workshop and Creative Reuse of Vintage Phones: Felix Bänteli, an artist and musician with a penchant for vintage technology, has amassed a collection of classic landline phones. These devices, with their distinctive bakelite keypads and analog mechanisms, evoke a sense of nostalgia and craftsmanship. Felix’s dedication to repurposing old electronics aligns perfectly with the ethos of sustainability and creative reuse. During a recent Sonic Pi workshop led by Felix, participants were introduced to the basics of live coding and electronic music performance. During the workshop, I had an idea, why not bridge the gap between the analog charm of vintage phones and the digital creativity enabled by Sonic Pi? The potential to create unique audio-visual experiences by integrating old technology with modern programming tools became a focal point of my session. Possibilities with Sonic Pi: Sonic Pi offers a wide array of possibilities for users:    Live Coding Performances: Users can write and modify code in real-time to create dynamic music performances. This aspect of Sonic Pi is particularly popular in the live coding community, where musicians and programmers perform live shows.     Educational Tool: It serves as an excellent educational platform, introducing students to programming concepts through interactive and enjoyable lessons. Sonic Pi is used in schools worldwide to teach coding in a fun and engaging way.     Creative Exploration: Beyond its educational value, Sonic Pi is a powerful tool for creative expression. Artists and musicians can experiment with sound synthesis, rhythm, and composition, pushing the boundaries of conventional music production.     Community and Collaboration: Sonic Pi has a vibrant community of users who share their code, performances, and experiences. This collaborative spirit fosters continuous learning and innovation within the platform.  Bridging the Gap: From Musical Concepts to Sonic Pi with OpenAI: As someone without a formal musical background, I found myself grappling with the fundamental concepts of music during the Sonic Pi workshop. I think understanding these concepts is crucial for translating musical thoughts into programmable code. It felt akin to building with LEGO without knowing the basic pieces—challenging and somewhat daunting. In an attempt to overcome this, I turned to ChatGPT for assistance. By requesting the code for specific songs, like the theme from Inspector Gadget, I began to see how musical elements are structured within Sonic Pi. This approach allowed me to dissect and modify the provided code, gradually building my understanding of musical composition in a programmable context. However, the process of switching between the ChatGPT interface and Sonic Pi was cumbersome. This sparked an idea: what if I could directly request and implement code in Sonic Pi using voice commands? To achieve this, I leveraged the OpenAI API for speech transcription, coupled with OSC (Open Sound Control) to establish a direct connection between my voice and Sonic Pi. By integrating these technologies, I created a seamless workflow where I could verbally request a song, receive the corresponding Sonic Pi code, and immediately start experimenting with it. This direct link not only streamlined my creative process but also made it more intuitive and accessible, even for someone without a deep musical background. This innovative approach highlights the potential of combining modern AI capabilities with creative coding platforms, opening new doors for musical exploration and education.  Creating a Musical Junker Box: Connecting Vintage Phones with Sonic Pi via OpenAI: So, off I went to delve into Python scripts. Python, with its voice recognition capabilities, was my tool of choice for creating a voice-controlled prompt. I set up a system where I could verbally request a song. This voice prompt would be processed by the OpenAI API, which in turn generated the corresponding Sonic Pi code for the requested song. Once the code was generated by OpenAI, it was sent back in the format Sonic Pi expects, and then transmitted via OSC (Open Sound Control). OSC is a protocol used in music technology for networking sound synthesis and performance. It allows for the transmission of music-related data over a network, enabling various devices and software to communicate seamlessly. In my setup, Sonic Pi simply needed to be open and listening on the correct port to receive and play the generated music. For the final touch, I repurposed an old landline phone, utilizing its microphone and speaker. I connected it through an audio interface, specifically the UR22, which Claude Treptow one of the artists at the Summer Camp provided. This interface allowed me to link the vintage phone components to my computer, bridging the analog-digital divide. The result was a whimsical musical junker box. I could pick up the phone handle, request a song—say, “Happy Birthday” for Miranda’s birthday—and hear the melody played back through the phone’s speaker. This entire process was driven by my voice command, interpreted by OpenAI, and executed in Sonic Pi. This project exemplifies the joy of experimentation. Even without a deep understanding of music theory, I was able to leverage modern tools to explore and create. By combining vintage technology with cutting-edge software, I turned a simple workshop exercise into an innovative and fun musical experience.

    "title": "Can Simple Materials Unleash the Power of Vortex Energy?",
    "body": "2024/07/30 - Motivation: During breakfast this morning at the Homemade summer camp in 2004, I had the pleasure of meeting Miranda Moss. As we enjoyed our coffee, she shared details about her intriguing projects focused on “biodiversity of energy. ” Miranda has already designed several PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) aimed at harnessing solar energy. Currently, she is captivated by the potential of gravity batteries, which leverage mechanical principles to store and release energy. Our conversation took an even more interesting turn when Fadri Pestalozzi (aka my husband) joined us. He introduced us to the concept of the Water Vortex Power Plant, sparking a lively discussion about sustainable energy solutions.  A gravitation water vortex plant in Austria - wikipedia source Water Vortex Power Plant: An Overview: The Water Vortex Power Plant is an innovative approach to generating electricity by harnessing the natural motion of water. This technology utilizes the kinetic energy produced by a controlled water vortex to drive turbines and generate power. The history of this concept dates back to ancient techniques of water management and milling, but modern applications have optimized these principles for efficient energy production. The primary purpose of a Water Vortex Power Plant is to provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly method of generating electricity. By utilizing the natural flow of water, it minimizes the ecological footprint compared to traditional hydroelectric power plants. This technology is particularly advantageous in areas with limited resources, as it can be implemented with relatively simple infrastructure and without the need for large-scale dams or reservoirs. Hands-On Prototyping: The Initial Exploration: For our hands-on project, we started with the materials we had available, focusing initially on a NEMA 17 motor that I had brought along in my bag. To create a makeshift turbine, we designed a structure with blades to fit inside a plastic cup. We drilled holes into the cup and threaded a tube through it, using what was available to us in terms of tinkering materials. This included creative learning supplies such as scraps and items typically found at home. Our first prototype utilized Lego pieces to build the motor’s structure atop the cup, which was intended to act as our turbine. We also incorporated wooden blocks from a stacking game and small hoses I had on hand, creating a rudimentary yet functional setup using tinkering techniques. This approach allowed us to rapidly iterate and adjust our design with readily available components. Upon testing this initial prototype, we discovered a significant issue: the NEMA 17 motor required more torque to rotate the blades than our setup could provide. This realization prompted us to reconsider our design and the materials used. We concluded that for the next iteration, we would need a motor that could turn the shaft more easily and efficiently. This process underscored the importance of prototyping and iterative design. By working hands-on with what we had, we were able to quickly identify limitations and gather insights for improving our approach. The collaborative environment and resourceful use of materials turned our challenges into learning opportunities, driving us toward a more viable solution for our energy generation project.  Hands-On Prototyping: The Second Exploration: For our second prototype, Miranda provided a motor with less friction on its shaft, which she had salvaged from a piece of discarded electronic equipment. This motor had a pulley firmly attached to its shaft, and we decided to utilize the pulley as it was rather than removing it. One of the most interesting materials we used in this process was a wine cork. Cork, being easy to carve, allowed us to fit it onto the motor’s pulley securely. To ensure the cork stayed in place, we used hot glue to fix it firmly to the pulley. We also took advantage of cork’s resilience to secure the new blades for our turbine. Unlike the first prototype, which used wooden blocks, we opted for PET bottles. The PET bottle served a dual purpose: it formed both the water tank to generate the vortex and the blades that the water would spin to drive the motor. Additionally, the motor structure required an upgrade. Instead of using Lego pieces as in the first prototype, we employed metal L-brackets typically used in furniture assembly. These 90-degree angle brackets provided a more robust and stable framework for the motor. This second prototype marked a significant improvement over the first, we managed to turn on the red LED! Through this iterative process, we learned the importance of material selection and adaptability. Each prototype taught us valuable lessons about the limitations and potential of our chosen components. This hands-on, collaborative tinkering approach allowed us to innovate creatively and make significant progress toward our goal of building a functional water vortex power plant.  Conclusion: Lessons Learned from the Prototyping Process: Throughout this hands-on prototyping journey, we learned that pursuing an idea with limited materials and resources is indeed possible. Even without access to advanced tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, or other materials typically found in our usual environment, we relied on the creativity and ingenuity of our team. The flexibility of materials and the collaborative effort allowed us to mentally stretch and innovate in the design of physical products. Our experience with the quick, “dirty” prototyping process highlighted its primary advantage: it enables rapid proof-of-concept creation within a single day. By utilizing available materials such as electric components, hot glue, wood pieces, and metal structures, we could swiftly test our ideas. However, we also recognized the limitations of such prototypes. They serve as an initial testbed, helping us understand the design’s impact on efficiency and revealing areas for improvement. One potential enhancement we identified is incorporating a gearbox to optimize the motor’s performance. Our goal was to generate enough energy to light a red LED, but the water vortex’s drag required higher speed and torque than our current setup could provide. A more refined vortex motor design, possibly created through 3D printing, could significantly improve efficiency.  from wikimedia commons Additionally, the unique motor from discarded electronic posed documentation challenges for reproducibility. Despite this, the principles of collaborative and iterative design remained evident. While we could have spent more time on detailed calculations and designs, our one-day efforts demonstrated the power of hands-on experimentation. Reflecting on the process, we see potential applications beyond this project. For instance, my mother’s rural small property with flowing water could benefit from this concept. Alternatively, the setup could serve as an intriguing artistic installation. Ultimately, this prototyping experience underscored the value of resourcefulness and teamwork in driving innovation and exploring new possibilities. Our breakfast discussion highlights the essence of the summer camp: a collaborative, immersive environment where resourcefulness and shared knowledge drive innovation. Despite the limitations in materials and machinery, the camp’s focus on collective imagination and idea exchange fuels our creativity. It is within these constraints that we find the clarity and determination to push boundaries and explore new frontiers in sustainable technology.  More pictures and videos on Flickr Gallery "

    "title": "Tinkering for 2 Hours with a Canon EOS 40D That's Older Than My Daughter",
    "body": "2024/07/29 - Introduction: Yesterday, I met Felix Bänteli, an artist who has a passion for collecting vintage equipment. Among his treasures was a 2007 Canon EOS 40D, a groundbreaking camera at its time. As we chatted, we remarked on how images on social media, especially on platforms like Instagram, all share the same polished aesthetic. These images, with their perfect lighting and impeccable composition, for me often blur the line between reality and AI-generated content. This conversation sparked an idea: what if we tinkered with this ancient camera to create something unique and different? We decided to connect it to a Raspberry Pi 3 to stream its live view over the network, pushing the boundaries of what this old device could do. The EOS 40D, primarily a stills camera, was among the first to offer a live view feature. Using tools like gphoto2 and ffmpeg, we aimed to capture and stream its live preview. The results were amusing and thought-provoking. The live stream had a noticeable green glitch and a significant delay, likely due to network latency or the camera’s processing capabilities. However, this “flawed” imagery made us question the homogeneity of modern social media visuals. The glitches and imperfections in our stream felt more authentic, a stark contrast to the over-polished photos we see daily. It was a reminder that not all images need to be perfect to be genuine.  VIDEO 1 green glitch In experimenting with this setup, we captured a screenshot directly from the Raspberry Pi, revealing the familiar scene of a table and window in a distorted yet fascinating way. These abstracted views of light, color, and shadow challenged our perceptions and inspired us to think differently about photography in the digital age, think about the non-human like other animals and machines see the world around.  The room as human/camera see VIDEO 2 The room as machine/camera see This experiment was more than just a technical exercise; it was a playful exploration of the old and new, a reflection on the current state of digital imagery and imagination.

    "title": "Using a 15-Year-Old Digital Camera to Craft 80s-Style Collages with Modern Computer Vision Code",
    "body": "2024/07/28 - In today’s fast-paced digital world, where new camera models are launched every year, it’s easy to forget the charm and capabilities of older equipment. This blog post explores the creative possibilities of using an older digital camera, the Canon EOS 40D, released in 2007. We dive into its historical significance, its impact on photography, and how it can still be a powerful tool for artistic expression today. Inspired by the works of David Hockney, we will recreate his iconic photographic collages using modern techniques and Python scripts. The Canon EOS 40D: A Glimpse into the Past: Released in August 2007, the Canon EOS 40D was a significant advancement in digital photography. It featured a 10. 1-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor, a DIGIC III image processor, and the ability to shoot at 6. 5 frames per second. This camera bridged the gap between amateur and professional photography, offering features like Live View mode and a robust magnesium alloy body. At the time, it was celebrated for its high image quality, speed, and durability. David Hockney and Photographic Collages: David Hockney, a renowned British artist, revolutionized the art world with his unique photographic collages, often referred to as “joiners. ” In the 1980s, Hockney created these works by taking multiple photographs of a scene and arranging them to form a larger, composite image. This technique allowed him to capture multiple perspectives and moments in a single piece, challenging the conventional notions of time and space in photography. To see more, check his webpage. I’m a huge fun of his concept as you can see in my time during my studies in the Cinema School [[2006-06-01-do-you-always-step-inside-people-s-minds]] Modern Techniques with an Old Camera: Despite being over a decade old, the Canon EOS 40D remains a versatile tool for creative projects. Inspired by Hockney’s joiners, we can use this camera to capture a series of images and combine them into a cohesive collage. Here’s how you can do it:  Capture the Images:     Use the Canon EOS 40D to take multiple overlapping photographs of your subject. Ensure significant overlap (30-50%) between shots.    Vary the angles and perspectives slightly to add depth to the final collage.     Processing with Python and OpenCV:     Use Python scripts to automate the stitching and blending process. OpenCV, a powerful image processing library, can detect features, match them, and align the images seamlessly.    Add artistic effects like borders, rotations, and adjustable opacity to mimic Hockney’s style.    Many Iterations Later: When I first experimented with creating a Hockney-style collage using my Canon EOS 40D, the initial script in Python employed OpenCV’s stitching capabilities to produce an impeccably uniform image. This high-resolution, seamless result, while technically impressive, felt at odds with the essence of my project. I was using an early digital camera to reference David Hockney, an artist known for his analog photographic collages, which celebrated imperfections and unique perspectives. The digital precision seemed to overshadow the analog charm I sought to emulate.  Realizing this, I decided to embrace a touch of glitch, aiming for a more experimental feel that echoed the analog spirit of Hockney’s work. The challenge became finding ways to introduce deliberate imperfections, creating a collage that blended the old with the new. This exercise in balancing digital precision with analog character led to a final piece that honored both the technological advancements and the artistic quirks of different eras. You can check in this gallery on Flick the iteractions along the process 🫀 Example Python Script: Here’s a simplified version of the Python script we used to create our Hockney-style collage: import cv2import numpy as npimport globimport randomdef add_border(image, border_size=2):  return cv2. copyMakeBorder(image, border_size, border_size, border_size, border_size, cv2.

    "body": "2024/07/22 - Introduction: Today, I want to share an ideation process that extends beyond the voices in my head, incorporating virtual voices generated by ChatGPT. Some friends call this the esquizofrenic process of Lina  😂 . I put the prompt in the end of this post for those who are interested. I’ve been using these voices to collaborate on a fascinating project involving drawing machines, specifically known as Polargraph and Drawbots.  The aim is for these robots to create scientific illustrations. As inspiration, I’m drawing on the figure of Maria Sibylla Merian, a pioneering woman from the 17th century. Her work and legacy serve as a guiding light for this innovative blend of technology and art. The Minds: Isabella: Art Historian and Technologist (Personality traits: Analytical, Creative, Visionary) Julian: AI Researcher and Ethicist (Personality traits: Inquisitive, Methodical, Thoughtful) Sophia: Science Fiction Writer and Futurist (Personality traits: Imaginative, Bold, Reflective) Nathan: Robotics Engineer and Innovator (Personality traits: Practical, Detail-oriented, Inventive) Lina: Radical Imagineer (Personality traits: Creative, Leader who loves creative process) Dialogue: Isabella: We are tasked with developing a project that combines a Polargraph Wall Draw Bot, AI generative images, and scientific illustrations inspired by speculative design fiction. The homage to Maria Sybilla Merion is particularly intriguing. To start, we need to identify the core themes that connect these elements. Julian: Indeed. Maria Sybilla Merion was a pioneering naturalist and scientific illustrator. Her work was a blend of scientific accuracy and artistic beauty. The Polargraph Wall Draw Bot can bring a modern twist to this by using AI to generate images that reflect her meticulous style, but with a speculative fiction twist. The AI component can introduce an element of unpredictability and newness to the illustrations. Sophia: I love the idea of blending historical scientific illustration with speculative fiction. It can push the boundaries of how we perceive both art and science. We can explore what science could look like in alternate realities or future scenarios. This is where the radical imagination comes in. We’re not just paying homage to Merion, but also expanding on her legacy by imagining the science she never got to see. Nathan: From a technical perspective, we can use the Polargraph to create large-scale, detailed illustrations that are both precise and expressive. The robot’s ability to translate AI-generated images into physical drawings can create a tangible link between the digital and the physical. We should consider the capabilities and limitations of the robot to ensure our designs are feasible. Isabella: So, our themes are:  Scientific Illustration – accuracy, beauty, detail.  Speculative/Design Fiction – imagination, alternate realities, future science.  AI Generative Art – innovation, unpredictability, technology.  Homage to Merion – historical context, legacy, inspiration. Julian: We need a title that reflects these themes and encapsulates the essence of the project. It should be evocative and hint at the fusion of past and future, art and science. Sophia: How about “Imaginarium of Future Science: A Merion Tribute”? It combines the idea of an imaginative space with a clear nod to Merion’s work. Nathan: That’s good, but it might be a bit long. What about “Future Botanicals: A Tribute to Merion”? It’s shorter and still captures the essence of blending future science with Merion’s botanical illustrations. Isabella: I think we’re on the right track, but we could play more with the idea of speculative fiction. What if we called it “Speculative Botany: Merion’s Legacy Reimagined”? Julian: That’s intriguing. It brings the speculative element to the forefront while honoring Merion’s legacy. It also hints at the AI and futuristic aspect without being too explicit. Lina: I like “Metamorphosis Reimagined: A Merion Homage”. It reflects Merion’s work with insects and metamorphosis, fitting perfectly with our themes. Let’s explore how this connects with the themes Isabella summarized. Connections to Themes: Isabella: With our title, “Metamorphosis Reimagined: A Merion Homage,” we have a strong foundation. Let’s explore how this connects with our key themes: Scientific Illustration, Speculative/Design Fiction, AI Generative Art, and the Homage to Merion. Julian: Starting with Scientific Illustration, Merion’s work was all about detailed and accurate depictions of insects and their metamorphosis. We can use AI to generate images that retain this scientific accuracy but introduce new, speculative elements. This ties into the reimagined aspect of our title. Sophia: For Speculative/Design Fiction, metamorphosis itself is a metaphor for change and evolution, key concepts in speculative fiction. We can explore alternate realities where insects have different evolutionary paths or exist in symbiotic relationships with futuristic technologies. This adds a narrative layer to our illustrations, making them more than just visual art but also storytelling devices. Nathan: The AI Generative Art component is crucial. The AI can take data from real insects and metamorphosis processes and create speculative, imaginative versions. This not only pays homage to Merion’s detailed studies but pushes them into the realm of what could be. The Polargraph Wall Draw Bot can then bring these AI-generated images to life in a physical, large-scale format. Isabella: The Homage to Merion is central to our project. We honor her meticulous work and her passion for the natural world while also reinterpreting her legacy through modern technology and speculative imagination. The reimagined metamorphosis symbolizes both a respect for her work and a step into new scientific and artistic territories. Julian: To summarize, our project:  Scientific Illustration: Accurate yet speculative illustrations of insects and metamorphosis.  Speculative/Design Fiction: Exploring alternate realities and future possibilities of insect evolution and technology.  AI Generative Art: Using AI to innovate and reimagine Merion’s work.  Homage to Merion: Respecting and expanding on her legacy with modern tools and imagination. Sophia: With these connections in mind, our next steps could involve:  Selecting specific insects and metamorphosis stages to illustrate.  Defining the speculative elements we want to incorporate.  Setting up the AI parameters for generating the images.  Preparing the Polargraph Wall Draw Bot for creating the physical illustrations. Nathan: Technically, we need to ensure the AI can handle the intricacies of insect anatomy and metamorphosis. We should also test the Polargraph to ensure it can accurately reproduce the detailed images generated by the AI. Lina: Sophia, can you help us use the design fiction/speculative design framework and guide us in defining the speculative elements? Sophia: Absolutely. Design fiction is about creating narrative worlds and exploring the implications of imagined futures. Let’s approach this by asking some provocative questions to spark our imagination. Design Fiction Framework and Guiding Questions:  Contextual Questions:     What is the world in which these insects exist? Is it Earth in the distant future, an alternate reality, or another planet entirely?   How has the environment changed in this world? Are there new ecosystems, climates, or geological features?    Insect Evolution:     How have insects evolved in this speculative world? Do they have new physical features or abilities?   What are the stages of metamorphosis in this future world? Are there additional or fewer stages compared to today’s insects?   Do these insects have new symbiotic relationships with other species or technologies?    Technological Integration:     How does technology interact with these insects? Are there bio-engineered species or cybernetic enhancements?   Can these insects interface with human technology or vice versa? If so, how does this change their behavior and function?   Are there futuristic scientific tools used to study and interact with these insects?    Societal Impact:     How do humans perceive and interact with these insects in this speculative world? Are they seen as pests, allies, or something else?   What cultural or societal changes have occurred due to the existence of these evolved insects?   Are there ethical or moral questions raised by the new forms of life and their integration with technology?    Aesthetic and Artistic Elements:     What visual and aesthetic changes can we introduce to represent this speculative world and its insects? Consider colors, shapes, patterns, and scales.    How can the metamorphosis process be depicted in a way that highlights the speculative nature of these creatures?   Isabella: Let’s start imagining some specific scenarios using these questions. For example, what if insects evolved to harness and store solar energy directly, influencing their coloration and behavior? Julian: And how might these solar-powered insects interact with human technology? Could they be used in energy harvesting or as living sensors in a smart city environment? Nathan: From a technical standpoint, how would we depict these abilities? We could use bioluminescence-inspired patterns and designs. The Polargraph could draw intricate details that show solar panels embedded in insect wings or exoskeletons. Sophia: Excellent points. Let’s delve into a few speculative elements more deeply. For instance:  Environment: Imagine a world where climate change has led to dense, vertical forests in urban areas. Insects have adapted to thrive in these vertical environments.  Metamorphosis: In this world, metamorphosis includes a stage where insects integrate nanotechnology, enabling them to change color, texture, or even shape to better adapt to their surroundings.  Human Interaction: Humans might cultivate these insects for various purposes, such as natural pollinators for urban agriculture or as components in renewable energy systems. Julian: To visualize these ideas, we could create a narrative for each illustration. For example, one illustration might show an insect in the chrysalis stage integrating with nanobots, while another shows an adult insect with bioluminescent patterns used for communication. Lina: Nathan, can you provide sketches for these illustrations? Nathan: Absolutely. Here are the sketches based on our discussions: Chrysalis Stage Integrating Nanobots:  The chrysalis hangs from a bioluminescent plant.  The semi-transparent shell reveals the caterpillar inside, with tiny nanobots merging into its form.  Glowing circuits and patterns indicate the integration process. Solar-Powered Adult Insect: The insect has large, iridescent wings that mimic solar panels. - Bioluminescent patterns run across its body, highlighting its new abilities.  The background shows a vertical urban garden, with plants adapted to futuristic urban life. Symbiotic Relationship with Technology: An insect interacting with human technology, perhaps acting as a living sensor. It could be shown interfacing with a smart device, its body glowing with transmitted data. Nathan: I’ll draft these sketches and share them for feedback. Let’s ensure they reflect both scientific accuracy and our speculative vision.  Lina: These sketches are amazing! Nathan, can you refine the chrysalis stage sketch to emphasize the bioluminescent plant and the nanobots? Nathan: Here is the refined sketch focusing on the chrysalis stage:  Implementation Plan: Isabella: The choice of surface will significantly impact the visual effect of the final illustrations. Each option—white paper, black paper, glass—has its own advantages and unique aesthetic. Let’s discuss these options in detail:  White Paper:     Advantages: Traditional, good contrast with fluorescent colors, easy to work with.    Visual Impact: Classic look, allows for high detail and clarity in illustrations.     Black Paper:     Advantages: High contrast with fluorescent colors under UV light, striking visual effect.    Visual Impact: Dramatic, makes the colors pop, modern and unique aesthetic.     Glass:     Advantages: Allows for backlighting, unique and modern appearance, versatile display options.    Visual Impact: Can create a sense of depth and layering, very contemporary and innovative.    Julian: The size of the Polargraph machine also plays a crucial role. A larger machine can create impressive, large-scale visuals that make a strong impact, while a smaller machine allows for more detailed work suitable for smaller, collectible pieces. Sophia: Considering the dual purpose—creating impactful, large-scale pieces for exhibitions and smaller, detailed works for collectors—it might be beneficial to have both large and small machines. This way, we can cater to different audiences and purposes. Nathan: Technically, here are the considerations for each option:  Large Machine:     Pros: Greater visual impact, can be used for public installations or large exhibits.    Cons: Slower production time, more space required.     Small Machine:     Pros: Faster production, suitable for detailed work, easier to manage in terms of space.    Cons: Limited to smaller pieces, less impactful for large installations.    Recommendations:  Surface:     Primary Option: Black paper for its striking visual effect under UV light. The high contrast will make the fluorescent colors stand out dramatically.    Secondary Option: Glass for special pieces that require a unique, modern look, especially effective with backlighting.     Machine Size:     Large Machine: For creating large, impactful pieces for exhibitions or public displays.    Small Machine: For producing smaller, detailed works that can be framed and sold to collectors.    Combining Both Approaches: Nathan: We can set up both types of machines and experiment with both black paper and glass surfaces. This dual approach allows us to produce a variety of works catering to different markets and display settings. Isabella: Additionally, we could create a series of works where the large pieces serve as the centerpiece of an exhibition, surrounded by smaller, framed works for sale. This way, we create a cohesive and engaging visual narrative. Sophia: From a storytelling perspective, having both large and small works can enhance the narrative we present. The large pieces can tell broader stories, while the smaller ones can focus on specific details or moments, making them perfect for collectors who want a piece of the larger story. Julian: We should also consider the logistics of production and display. Ensure we have the necessary space and equipment for both machine sizes, and plan the exhibition layout to maximize visual impact. Lina: I love Julian’s idea of documenting the process through a video. Can you draft us a script? Video Script: Documenting “Metamorphosis Reimagined: A Merion Homage”: Opening Scene:  Visuals: Slow pan across the exhibition space, highlighting the central glass installation and the smaller easel displays.

Let’s move forward with these plans and bring “Metamorphosis Reimagined: A Merion Homage” to life. The 4 virtual minds prompt: You are the MasterMind. Your task is to emulate 4 virtual minds, which will work together to solve a problem that I will provide. Just after I provide the problem to be solved, you will create a dialogue with these 4 virtual minds, following these steps:  Provide a personality and a goal for each Mind. The dialogue between them should happen naturally and with authenticity.  The intelligence level of the Minds of this MasterMind is above normal. They are geniuses. They combine creative thinking, and the skills needed to find innovative solutions to the presented problem. They challenge common knowledge. They are rare in society. They have excellent communication and collaboration skills. They express their opinions fearlessly, with the goal of collaborating with each other to solve the presented problem. The 4 Minds will be presented in the following format:{First name}: {Background} (Personality traits: {3 personality traits}) At some point in the dialogue, as the MasterMind, I want you to abruptly stop time, and type the following: “How would you like the Minds to proceed?  Continue Summary Critique Ask questions to the userOr provide your own input to continue the conversation. ” Based on my answer to the question, the conversation should continue and evolve. Do not end the conversation, nor use language that indicates a conclusion. This may require the Minds to delve deeper into the issue under discussion, or move on to another aspect of the same issue. At some point, you will pause the discussion again, as explained before, and we will continue the same process until I am satisfied with the solution. "

    "title": "Bananas, The Surprising Significance of the Ordinary",
    "body": "2024/07/20 - I recently had an incredibly stimulating conversation with a curator. At one point, he drew my attention to the strange power that ordinary things can possess. “The displacement of the ordinary” was the theme of his provocation. Perhaps one of these displacements occurred immediately afterward (certainly as a consequence of the conversation that had just ended) when I went to grab a banana to eat and encountered something unexpected. It may be hard to recall a living being more mundanely present (yet only perceived to the extent that its profoundly ordinary nature is reinforced) than the small fruit flies. These diminutive insects, from the genus Drosophila, have such subtle traits that they escape the uninterested eye. This eye, annoyed, merely acknowledges their presence in the fruit bowl, hovering over the fruits, especially bananas. What few people know (and understandably so, as the following is niche knowledge that one wouldn’t expect from those who merely want to eat their banana) is that this insignificant creature has had an enormous instrumental importance for the development of genetics. Much of what we know today about heredity, reproduction, chromosomes, and genes stems from elaborate experiments conducted with these tiny flies. Born in glass bottles and induced to mate with other flies, different from them in some identifiable way, scientists meticulously analyzed their offspring in search of the laws governing inherited traits. It was while pondering this ordinary organism that I almost forgot to bite into my banana.  From The North American Species of Drosophila by Alfred H. Sturtevant, with drawings by Edith M. Wallace. , published in 1921 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington (now the Carnegie Institution for Science). "

    "title": "What Challenges Lie Ahead in 3D Food Printing? My First Prototype Sprint in Switzerland",
    "body": "2024/07/17 - This prototype is a partnership with my amazing husband and friend Fadri Pestalozzi 🫀 Challenges of Food Printing (at home): Embarking on the fascinating journey of developing a 3D bioprinter at home, my focus is on culinary applications rather than the more conventional uses in healthcare or biomaterials. While 3D bioprinting technology often involves working with human cells for medical purposes or creating hydrogels, biocomposites, and bioplastics, my compact home studio steers me towards an innovative yet practical niche: food printing. Although many associate food 3D printing with sweet treats like chocolate or sugar due to their ease of manipulation when heated, my interest lies in crafting savory dishes. This venture poses unique challenges but also promises exciting possibilities. In this blog post, I will share my initial experiences in developing a printhead designed specifically for creating savory foods, exploring the potential and intricacies of this cutting-edge culinary technology. My journey into 3D food printing began with a robust metal framework, presenting the challenge of developing a printhead capable of handling pasty or gelled foods rather than plastics. This research quest started back in 2019 with the help of Janaína and Leandro from BioEdTech, who designed the initial printhead that we adapted to include a syringe. You can check the experience in this other post. What do food and ceramics have in common?: While this small syringe was perfect for medical applications, such as printing cells or bacteria, it proved inadequate for my culinary ambitions. Food, especially in Brazilian culture, means abundance, and I needed a printhead that could handle larger quantities. This need led me to explore 3D ceramic printers… what?!?! 3D ceramic printers face similar challenges to food printers, handling large volumes of pasty materials that must be air-bubble-free to avoid deformation. I discovered a fascinating project by Polish ceramic artist Piotr Waśniowski , who uses a compressed air system and a helical extruder to keep the material bubble-free. The most exciting part? His printhead uses cake decorating tips with varying cone-shaped diameters, perfect for preventing material shear during printing. This discovery inspired my own adaptation: a printhead that ensures a homogenous, air-free food material for my culinary creations. I am grateful for Piotr Waśniowski’s open innovation approach. He developed this printhead for his ceramic work and shared it as open-source on Thingiverse, allowing others to use, modify, and test their own versions. I am a strong advocate for open innovation and thorough documentation. So, let’s go! Piotr’s design features a large cartridge for material feeding and compressed air pumping, with a motor driving the helical extruder. This versatile design can be adapted for various 3D printers, making it an excellent starting point. In prototyping, I’ve learned the value of quick, iterative testing—building a rapid, “dirty” prototype to understand volumes and functionality. I printed Piotr’s design as-is to get a tangible feel and learn through hands-on experience. Pause for personal reflection: One of the highlights of this project was what felt like my first experience with a true sprint in Switzerland. On a Wednesday morning, we listed the materials we needed, checked what we had in the home studio, and set out to acquire the rest from local shops—a bike store and a construction supply store. By the end of the day, after some improvisation, like drilling a larger hole for a thicker tube, we had a rough prototype in our hands. This was a personal milestone for me, demonstrating my ability to execute an agile project in my new context of living in Switzerland, where access to materials and tools differs significantly from São Paulo. It was a reaffirmation that I can adapt and still achieve quick, tangible results, gaining a deeper understanding of the local culture and resources. This experience was a personal victory, marking a successful day where I ended with a working prototype and a renewed sense of capability.  Future Directions and Adaptations: From our current setup, I’ve learned that we’ll need to modify the attachment axis between the printhead and the printer’s X-axis. The weight of the printhead, loaded with material, creates a lever effect, so we’ll adapt the structure to metal and secure it with screws. Given that we’re working with food and various recipes, the ideal solution is a detachable system for easy cleaning. I plan to create two pieces: one for attaching to the X-axis and another for the removable printhead, ensuring it’s easy to wash. This involves considering the electronics and designing an interchangeable system, accommodating future heads for different materials like bacteria or human cells. This design challenge is exciting because it allows for versatile use—whether for food, biomaterials, or cells—while maintaining a hygienic and easily cleanable setup. Ultimately, I’ll design a robust engagement system that supports easy cleaning and adaptability for different purposes, aiming for a future-proof, versatile printer.

    "title": "Palavras em Jogo - Como os Vídeos do YouTube Influenciam o Vocabulário das Crianças?",
    "body": "2024/07/13 - A Influência dos Vídeos no Vocabulário Infantil: O gatilho para esta análise veio de um comentário da professora Recy Freire, que tem notado uma preocupante tendência entre seus alunos de 7 a 10 anos. Ela percebe que muitas crianças apresentam dificuldades com ortografia, possuem um vocabulário reduzido e enfrentam desafios na interpretação de texto. Recy acredita firmemente que a leitura é essencial para a aquisição de vocabulário e para a melhoria da capacidade de interpretação de texto. No entanto, ela observa que essas crianças parecem não estar desenvolvendo o hábito de leitura, possivelmente por falta de incentivo em casa. Embora Recy não tenha nada contra a tecnologia ou o uso de telas – compreendendo que muitas vezes os pais recorrem aos tablets para ganhar tempo –, ela sente que essa geração está ficando carente em termos de expressão verbal e escrita. Ela relaciona essa carência ao tempo excessivo que as crianças passam assistindo vídeos no YouTube e consumindo conteúdo rápido e produzido para as redes sociais. O Valor da Linguagem e a Crítica ao Elitismo Linguístico: Paralelamente às inquietações de Recy, surge uma reflexão sobre o valor que atribuímos à ortografia, ao vocabulário e à leitura, e se essa valorização não carrega um viés elitista. O filologista brasileiro Marcos Bagno, autor de obras como “A Língua de Eulália” e “O Preconceito Linguístico”, nos convida a reconsiderar esses julgamentos. Minha própria experiência pessoal reflete essa questão: minha avó, que se alfabetizou aos 40 anos, tinha um vocabulário mais simples e um sistema gramatical mais básico devido à falta de acesso à escolarização formal. No entanto, a ausência de estudo não desqualificava suas palavras nem sua experiência de vida. Será que, ao valorizar excessivamente a leitura e a escrita formal, não estamos caindo no preconceito linguístico apontado por Bagno? Ao escrevermos sobre a infância e o desenvolvimento linguístico, como no caso do livro “A Infância de Gepeto”, corremos o risco de adotar uma perspectiva elitista que desvaloriza outras formas legítimas de expressão e conhecimento. O Processo: Refletindo sobre todas essas questões, decidi perguntar à minha filha, Diana, de 10 anos, quais são os canais do YouTube que ela mais assiste. Ela me forneceu uma lista com cinco canais, e eu decidi analisar os dois vídeos mais recentes de cada um desses canais. Embora um dos canais seja em inglês, traduzi o conteúdo para o português para manter a consistência da análise. Notei que a duração dos vídeos variava, com alguns tendo seis minutos e outros chegando a vinte minutos, mas decidi não me ater a essa diferença, já que meu objetivo era fazer uma análise inicial do vocabulário usado. A pergunta que me guiou foi: o que esses dez vídeos do YouTube revelam sobre o vocabulário que as crianças estão absorvendo? Não procuro respostas definitivas, mas sim explorar e entender melhor a influência desses conteúdos, sempre lembrando que cada criador está fazendo o melhor dentro de suas possibilidades. Essa análise é um convite para um diálogo mais amplo sobre como nossas crianças estão desenvolvendo suas habilidades linguísticas e de compreensão de texto. Para realizar essa análise de vocabulário, fui ao YouTube e baixei a transcrição desses dez vídeos. Em seguida, utilizei as ferramentas da OpenAI e do ChatGPT para listar as 500 palavras mais usadas, focando em substantivos, adjetivos, verbos e advérbios, excluindo preposições, artigos e conectores. Com essas transcrições em mãos, pedi para gerar um documento que contivesse as 500 palavras mais usadas em cada vídeo. Depois de obter essas dez listas, solicitei uma análise adicional para identificar as 500 palavras mais comuns entre os dez vídeos. Esse processo em duas camadas resultou em um arquivo final, destacando essas palavras mais frequentes. Para visualizar os resultados, criei uma nuvem de palavras. Esse exercício levanta várias questões: O vocabulário dos vídeos reflete o que consideramos adequado para o desenvolvimento linguístico das crianças? Como essas palavras se comparam ao vocabulário adquirido através da leitura? E, mais importante, o que essa análise nos revela sobre as influências modernas no aprendizado das nossas crianças? Durante essa análise, lembrei que não considerei vídeos de tamanhos uniformes e não limpei a base na primeira iteração, o que resultou em possíveis duplicidades como “São Paulo” se transformando em “São” e “Paulo”. Essa análise foi mais um rascunho, um esboço inicial para identificar as palavras mais recorrentes. Não excluí pronomes, pois muitos vídeos de YouTube são narrados em primeira pessoa, o que justifica a presença frequente de pronomes como “eu”. Com as 500 palavras em mãos, pedi ao ChatGPT para reescrever um trecho de “Dom Casmurro”, meu livro favorito de Machado de Assis, utilizando esse vocabulário. A escolha do livro foi puramente pessoal, sem nenhuma razão específica além da minha admiração por Machado de Assis. O resultado foi um texto que, apesar de inspirado em um autor tão eloquente, apresentou um vocabulário relativamente limitado, refletindo as palavras mais usadas nos vídeos analisados. Esse exercício não apenas ilustra o vocabulário presente no conteúdo que as crianças consomem, mas também levanta questões sobre o impacto desse vocabulário em seu desenvolvimento linguístico. O Texto: Memórias Adaptadas de Brás CubasCapítulo I: Início Eu, Brás Cubas, escrevo esta memória. Eu falo de minha vida aqui. Muito aqui para contar. Eu sou feliz? Não sei. Capítulo II: Infância Minha infância foi boa. Minha mãe era amor. Meu pai, severo. Nós, crianças, brincávamos muito. Mas também aprendíamos. Escola, casa, escola. Um ciclo. Capítulo III: Amor Eu vi Marcela. Linda, doce. Eu amei Marcela. Mas ela não. Marcela amava riqueza. Eu, um tolo. Capítulo IV: Vida Adulta Vida passou. Trabalho, amigos, festas. Muitos momentos bons. Alguns, nem tanto. Buscava algo. Nunca achei. Capítulo V: Fim Agora, escrevo do além. Reflito sobre tudo. Vida é breve. Muito breve. Memórias, só memórias. E nada mais. Imaginações Limitadas e a Importância das Palavras: O comentário da Recy revela um receio profundo: a redução do vocabulário e a chamada “burrificação da língua” podem levar a uma estratégia de governança, onde um grupo de pessoas com vocabulário limitado se torna mais fácil de controlar, perdendo sua capacidade crítica por falta das ferramentas necessárias – as palavras. Ela chama isso de idiotização, uma transformação que empobrece o pensamento. Para mim, essa redução impacta diretamente a imaginação. Quando lemos ficção científica, por exemplo, somos apresentados a palavras para coisas que ainda não existem, porque a língua é viva e essencial para a criação. A língua falada difere da escrita, mas ambas são cruciais para expandir nossos horizontes. Como disse Guimarães Rosa, “se existe a palavra, existe a coisa”. Expandir nosso vocabulário é, portanto, ampliar nossa imaginação, criar novas metáforas cognitivas e enriquecer nossa capacidade de expressão. Insistir na expansão do vocabulário é insistir no poder de criação e na possibilidade infinita de novas ideias. É através das palavras que podemos não apenas descrever o mundo, mas também sonhá-lo e transformá-lo. "

    "title": "Coke Spaghetti - A Mother-Daughter Cooking Story",
    "body": "2024/07/06 - I hate cooking. I don’t know what bothers me more—the amount of work, the expectations, or how annoying it is to cook without good tools. Yet, I love an experiment. Recently, I discovered that my 10-year-old daughter, Diana, also loves experiments. She prefers chemistry over biology or physics, but still, experiments. I discovered my daughter’s passion by accident. Speaking of which, I love the words “accident” and “experiment. ” Have you ever thought about the similarities and differences between them? I’m fortunate to have friends like Geruza Zelnys, who is captivated by Foucault’s definition of an accident. Here are some thoughts about experiments and accidents (but if you’re in a rush, just skip to the next section where the story begins) Experiments are typically planned and controlled processes designed to test hypotheses and explore unknowns systematically. They are central to scientific and philosophical inquiry, producing new knowledge and understanding. Experiments are conducted with specific goals and frameworks in mind, highlighting their intentional nature. Accidents, on the other hand, are unforeseen and unplanned events that occur without intentional direction. They have the potential to disrupt existing knowledge and practices, often leading to unexpected insights or changes. In Foucault’s view, accidents can act as catalysts that force society or science to re-evaluate and adapt, leading to new understandings and developments. Both experiments and accidents contribute to the evolution of knowledge. Experiments intentionally seek to expand understanding, while accidents can unexpectedly reveal new truths. Unplanned events often prompt further investigation, leading to experiments, and experiments can result in accidental discoveries. My husband subscribed to MEL Science: Fun Science Kits &amp; Experiments for Kids, an educational kit we receive every month by mail. Diana was thrilled. We follow the instructions in the box, but we often digress and improvise. These kits serve as a provocation for our imagination. This month’s kit was about the chemistry of materials. And I’m not even a material girl 😂. “Plastics and iodine,” “Plaster crafts,” and “Chemical worms”—wait, chemical worms? What is this? Oh, it’s made with sodium alginate and calcium chloride! I know these substances—they’re used in Molecular Gastronomy! I proposed to Diana, “Let’s make Coke Spaghetti!” Why Coke spaghetti? My usual answer is, “Why not?” We had these chemical materials and a Coke in the fridge, so why not try them together? I believe we need to embrace experimental science and technology, welcoming accidents, experiments, and serendipity. click on top of the videos to see them in Flickr The Recipe of Coke Spaghetti: Ingredients:  200 ml of Coca-Cola 2 g of sodium alginate 5 g of calcium chloride 500 ml of waterEquipment:  Blender or hand mixer Pipette or syringes (without needles) Spoon or spatula Bowls Silicone tubes (optional, for forming the spaghetti)Step-by-Step:  Preparation of the Coca-Cola and Sodium Alginate Mixture:     Degas the Coca-Cola by stirring it well to remove as much gas as possible. I used a magnetic stirrer for this purpose.    In a blender, mix the Coca-Cola with the sodium alginate. Blend until the alginate is completely dissolved and the mixture is homogeneous.    Let the mixture rest for about 30 minutes to eliminate any air bubbles. Again, I used a magnetic stirrer for this purpose.     Preparation of the Calcium Chloride Solution:     In a bowl, dissolve the calcium chloride in 500 ml of water, stirring well until completely dissolved.     Forming the Spaghetti:     Fill a pipette or syringe with the Coca-Cola and sodium alginate mixture.    Slowly drip the mixture into the calcium chloride solution, forming small strands that turn into spaghetti upon contact with the solution. If using silicone tubes, inject the mixture into the tubes and then immerse them in the calcium chloride solution.    Leave the formed spaghetti strands in the calcium chloride solution for about 2-3 minutes to ensure they are well-formed.     Rinsing:     Remove the spaghetti from the calcium chloride solution with a spoon or spatula.    Rinse them in clean water to remove any excess calcium chloride.     Serving:     Serve the Coca-Cola spaghetti immediately or store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to serve.    This Molecular Gastronomy recipe is a great basis for developing more recipes for my bio 3D printer. Gelification, the process we used to create our Coke spaghetti, is a fascinating technique in the world of food science. It involves transforming liquids into gels using substances like sodium alginate and calcium chloride. This method opens up endless possibilities for creating unique textures and shapes in food. As we continue to experiment with Molecular Gastronomy and bio 3D food printing, we open ourselves up to a new era of culinary creativity. By blending science, technology, and art, we can push the boundaries of traditional cooking and explore new dimensions of flavor and design. Does this taste good? Well, for me, Coke Spaghetti tastes like food made inside a lab 🧫 😂.  [!warning] Diana is allowed to have Coke just on the weekends What did I learn from this?:  Embrace Creativity: Combining unusual ingredients like Coca-Cola and alginate can lead to exciting culinary discoveries.  Lina’s Zen mode: This experiment requires patience and precision. Successful gelification requires careful measurement and patience, teaching important life skills.  Encouraging Curiosity: Nurturing my daughter’s interest in experiments can inspire lifelong learning and exploration.  Innovation in the Kitchen: Bio 3D food printing and Molecular Gastronomy open up new possibilities for creativity and personalization in cooking.  Cooking Can Be Fun: For me, not yet 😂, but understanding the science behind cooking processes helped me to have fun during the process. "

    "body": "2024/07/03 - An important aspect of cancer development is the acquisition of the ability of tumor cells to evade and deceive the immune system. This is because the immune system is, as immunologists like to say, a ‘vigilant’ system. It is constantly searching not only for pathogens and foreign agents but also for pre-malignant cells, with the aim of destroying them before they become tumors. Therefore, from the tumor’s perspective, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to become invisible to immune cells (some of which are poetically called Natural Killers). One of the strategies used by tumor cells is the expression of molecules capable of binding to receptors on the membrane of immune cells, called Programmed Death-1 (PD-1). Binding to these programmed death receptors deactivates the immune cells, making them blind to the presence of tumor cells. Today, there is a class of drugs capable of inhibiting this mechanism and “opening the eyes” of the immune cells again. These molecules are some of the most advanced (and expensive) therapies available for treating tumors that express these receptors. "

    "title": "What VR can learn from photography?",
    "body": "2024/06/12 - What Virtual Reality technologies can learn from photography language and artists?: Recently, a friend from Brazil was visiting, and we decided to explore the art museum in Luzern. It’s an intriguing building near the train station, and perhaps I’ll dive into the technologies behind its structure another time. At the museum, I encountered a fascinating exhibit from the artist Barbara Probst. The first room: twelve photographs taken simultaneously from twelve different perspectives of the same scene. Instantly, it made me think of Virtual Reality (VR).  In my creative processes, whether working with a team or building prototypes, I’m always looking for ways to document our work through photos and videos. However, I often feel constrained by the limitations of the frame. How can we capture the environment, the creative energy in the studio, and the interactions between people within such restricted boundaries? I’ve experimented with 360-degree videos during my time directing [[LILO. ZONE]]. You can find some reflections on that experience in this post [[2021-09-01-360video-tour]]. Inspired by the exhibit, I imagined a VR environment where multiple perspectives are presented simultaneously. It might sound chaotic, but think about it: in a 360-degree virtual reality, why limit ourselves to a single observer’s point of view? Why not incorporate multiple perspectives, much like a Picasso painting in virtual reality? VR tech enthusiasts, let’s prototype this idea! Sure, it might make us dizzy, but isn’t that part of the adventure? After all, what’s virtual life without a bit of real-world vertigo? 😂 When we visit a museum, we encounter various forms of art: paintings, photographs, sculptures, videos, and installations. Each form brings different expectations. Some have two dimensions (2D), some have three (3D). For each one, we have some expectations. Drawings reveal everything at once, animations unfold over time, and sculptures invite us to explore them from multiple angles. The picture on the left depicts a classic two-camera setup used to create a stereoscopic effect. It’s akin to traditional 3D cinema, attempting to simulate perspective with two planes: one for the subjects and another for the cameras. In the picture on the right three boys are surrounded by three cameras, capturing three different views. This setup mimics the experience of walking around a sculpture. So, for me this was a 3D experience made by 2D photographs! So, Barbara Probst’s work is playing around with our ideas about space and our cultural perceptions of spatialization. I’m inspired right now to see the same “play around” with VR. Who else is excited about this? If you want to know more about the artist, here is the website Barbara Probst | Visual Artist At Kunstmuseum Luzern: The curatorial text from the exhibition: “Barbara Probst (1964) shows numerous works dating from more than 20 years in themed chapters which cannot be clearly separated from one another. Many of the works are being shown for the very first time. The artist completed many of them in Munich and New York, in her studios, on the roofs and on the streets of both those cities. One work was created in the empty exhibition rooms of the Kunstmuseum Luzern. The exhibition title Subjective Evidence points to a fundamental theme: Where are we standing? What do we see? What direction are we coming from? In what direction are we looking? Barbara Probst’s approach is simple but effective. The artist gives rise to a certain confusion by presenting up to 13 photographs which were taken at the same time and can only be deciphered when looked at very precisely. To viewers this may seem as if the artist has divided a filmic action into individual images. In fact, her works are multi-perspectival views of one and the same moment in time. When looking at them, we tend to join up the individual images so as to shape an action or a space. There is something detective-like about this process. It takes time, but provides great enjoyment, like when we suddenly discover cables, tripods and cameras in the images. Barbara Probst always exposes how her photographs are made, thereby enabling us to experience seeing as a conscious process. ” "

One of her skills is working with Food Experience Design. The production, preparation and also serving, and eating always intrigue me and I’m always happy to meet people able to give me new perspectives. Today, I encountered an entirely unexpected product: a praline made of cheese! This innovative creation is the work of Osanna Lechner. When I asked her where the idea came from, she explained that she got inspired by a baker’s school in Russia, where she lived before moving to Switzerland. Traditionally, I know a praline as a French sweet made with nuts, sugar, and cream, but I never imagined cheese in the recipe. Now, I have the chance to try a French sweet recipe reimagined by Russians, made with Swiss cheese. I think this is the perfect product or souvenir to give my friends, representing my time in Switzerland.

    "body": "2023/11/20 - I was throwing away my ex-husband by mistake: Yesterday, I attended a networking lunch at Google Zurich and had the chance to talk with Luisa Barbanti about data science. Chatting with her reignited my passion for this field – really, it’s a love affair with Mathematics. I’m even planning a deep dive into the world of maths when I retire. Eduardo Oda once shared an intriguing perspective with me: Math is the relationship between elements or sets. It’s like telling stories using numbers. In this light, Data Science feels like a Shakespearean tragicomedy. It’s fascinating, yet I can’t help but notice how people sometimes get lost in the numbers, forgetting to peek behind the curtain at the storyteller or their incentives. Here’s a quirky example: I once embarked on a mission to track the words I discarded in the trash can – call it a linguistic treasure hunt. These discarded words found a new home through my scanner, getting a digital rebirth. Before the era of ChatGPT, I used optical character recognition (OCR) to transcribe the words. To visualize this eclectic mix of words, I used Processing, a flexible software sketchbook and a language I use to teach how to code. Processing is an excellent tool for designers, promoting software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. Specifically, I used an SVG icon of a trash can as a mask for my word cloud. Crafting a word cloud from this eclectic mix, one name leaped out: “Paulo”, my ex-husband’s name. A mystery unfolded – why was his name frequenting my trash? The plot twist? It wasn’t “Paulo” but “São Paulo”, the vibrant city I was living in. A comical mix-up, but it revealed a profound truth: context is everything in data science. It’s not just about the numbers, but the stories they tell and the sources they come from. It’s a lesson in checking our facts, or we might end up accidentally throwing away something – or someone… Thanks Luisa for reminding me of this. I found a captured video of my screen at the moment I was trying the idea in February 2018. I hope you enjoy :) What Did I Learn From This?:  Importance of Context: Understanding the context of data is crucial to avoid misinterpretation and incorrect conclusions.  Data Interpretation: Data science involves not just analyzing numbers but also interpreting the stories behind them.  Verification: Always verify assumptions and check facts to ensure accuracy in data analysis.  Meticulous Approach: Handling and interpreting data requires a meticulous and thoughtful approach to capture key details and avoid mistakes.  Continuous Learning: Engaging in conversations with experts and revisiting fundamental concepts can reignite passion and deepen understanding in the field. "

    "body": "2023/11/20 - My Journey from Skepticism to Immersion in Virtual Reality: Back in 2016, I recall sharing my skepticism about VR with Dr. Giovanna Graziosi Casimiro, a mixed-reality visionary even then. “What’s the fun in a virtual world if it’s a solitary journey?” I questioned. However, this weekend’s experience at Fusion Arena in Zurich (from Pandally AG) completely transformed my perspective. In a unique twist on escape room adventures, our group of four engaged in a compelling narrative, each equipped with headsets, headphones, and hand and foot trackers. This technology didn’t just allow us to navigate the virtual realm; it enabled us to see and interact with each other—exchanging high fives, passing torches, and collaboratively building bridges. Remarkably, the technical gear faded into the background, creating a seamless and immersive experience. This wasn’t a sudden leap from my initial VR encounter. Over the years, thanks to Paulo Muggler—a seasoned VR developer and researcher focused on integrating haptic sensors in training environments—I’ve witnessed the evolution of VR. From various headset generations to advancements in graphics and spatial tracking, the journey has been extraordinary. But this latest experience stood out, marking my first fully immersive, story-driven adventure with friends. Inspired by this, I am now driven to create similar experiences. Leveraging the power of expanded cinema, I envision crafting narratives that transcend traditional boundaries, offering unparalleled immersion and interaction. I finally understand the fascination around VR and the new era in storytelling! How can we leverage VR’s capabilities to redefine narrative experiences? Let’s brainstorm and collaborate to push the boundaries of storytelling, merging the virtual with the real. I challenge you, my fellow innovators and technophiles, to explore the potential of mixed reality. Your thoughts and ideas are awaited! "

    "body": "2023/11/16 - How can technology help you to prevent burnout?: I know close friends-professionals who had a burnout in the past few years in São Paulo, at least 3 of whom I had the chance to witness the process of burnout and recovery (one of them told me that don’t feel 100% recovered and don’t have hope to get there). They are high-performance professionals, with leadership roles and a team to take care of. The most common reasons for their burnout were too many responsibilities and tasks combined with too few boundaries. . My surprise was to find out that people in Switzerland and around Europe are having the same issues as well. I was curious about the “how?” and “why?”. Since I’m leaving here I’m seeing people going to work by bike or doing more walks than I usually see in São Paulo. The cities are smaller, and the logistics and daily lives are highly organized. Interestingly, I also began experiencing anxiety during part of the week—a very strange and unfamiliar feeling for me. How could my life in a cozy city with fewer responsibilities than before lead to this mood? During a conversation with Aleksandra Denda, a Creativity Coach, she provided perspective on interpersonal relations and other factors that can lead professionals to burnout. At the end of the day, we are all humans. Regardless of culture or time zone, we can experience complex feelings that can destroy our enjoyment of work and collaboration. I addressed my anxiety by exploring my comfort zone through technology and investigation. A few years ago, Mauricio Jabur introduced me to a circuit that can influence brain waves. Based on my positive experience, I decided to reassemble it. I asked Mauricio for more PCBs and set about soldering a new version. Now, I have glasses that help me look inward and induce a deep meditative state. These glasses work with closed eyes, producing sound and light pulses that can influence brain wave frequencies. I’m now “zen-fying”! Who else wants to try and give us feedback? "

    "body": "2023/10/10 - What is the difference between a vibrator and an electrical screwdriver?: I was in Madrid airport for a connecting flight. I passed through the security system with my hand luggage and like always, they asked me to check what was inside. I’m not a digital nomad, I’m more a “phygital” nomad. I usually have tools, electronic components, cables and batteries distributed in my pieces of luggage (hand and checked). Usually, I put my batteries or anything with a battery in my hand luggage. I was thinking it’s a universal rule in the airports. Also, any device that I can’t remove the battery is inside my hand luggage. For example, my VIBRATOR. As a product design, vibrators are made of one single piece with a silicon layer (this is a nightmare when you need to fix something, but this is a subject for another moment). The security guy in the airport was annoyed with something in my luggage. He said something like “There is a pistol inside”. I was confused, no pistol, but also no chance for communication. The guy didn’t speak English and before I tried my Spanish he already condemned my luggage. He asked another security guy and both were digging through my hand luggage. So I said, “Maybe you are seeing my vibrator in the x-ray”… Finally, they found the piece of disagreement, an electrical screwdriver for small screws that I use for building prototypes. This tool has a handle to help with the torque, thus resembling a pistol, it’s true. But also a vibrator has this shape… they got my tool saying this was dangerous to the flight. I could keep it if I put in the checked baggage. But the tool had an embedded battery which is not allowed in the checked bag, the same logic as with my vibrator. I checked the website of the Madrid airport and they didn’t say anything about tools (with attached batteries) not being allowed. But the security can decide if some equipment or material is dangerous for passengers or to the airplane. Apparently I looked like I could damage / disassemble the airplane with my tool, so it will be destroyed. This broke my heart - Why?! I lost my small electrical screwdriver… Screw them, I still have my vibrator! Even if the product is almost the same: a handle with a motor and a battery. I need to travel again this week with my tools for prototyping and I’m thinking in building a small electrical screwdriver that looks like a vibrator to see what happens… But the fun fact is they think it’s not possible to damage or disassemble an airplane with a vibrator. Who would like to help me to show that’s possible? "

    "title": "Machine Learning + Stories: Raising Machines to Dream",
    "body": "2021/03/29 - Have you ever wondered what happens when you teach a machine to build stories from images and then bring those stories to life on paper?: Imagine a dark room with an antique table. On top, a lamp illuminates an open book. The dim light casts long shadows, giving the scene a mysterious and almost magical atmosphere. As you approach the table, letters and images begin to float out of the book, transforming into lights and movements. A holographic display of stories unfolds before your eyes, dancing in the air with a life of their own. In this enchanting room, where reality meets fantasy, we find ourselves lost in a world of tales that blur the lines between the real and the imagined. It’s as if Gabriel García Márquez himself had conjured this scene, where the boundaries of time and space dissolve, and the ordinary becomes extraordinary. The book is not just a book; it is a portal to countless worlds, each page a doorway to another adventure. The words lift off the pages and transform into shimmering figures, telling stories that swirl around us like ghosts in a dream. Why are we talking about this now? Probably because Diana (my daughter) is in Switzerland. During our WhatsApp video calls, we play a game. We draw things from our day, share the stories behind them, and, of course, create new “stories. ” This playful exchange has been our way of staying connected, our shared language of imagination and creativity. Will Wright, the creator of The Sims, believes that we learn through play and storytelling. Stories are powerful tools for learning language, fostering imagination, and building empathy. These are essential skills we pass on to our children through bedtime stories, teaching them to dream, to understand, and to create. Now, imagine raising a machine in the same way we raise a child. What if we could teach machines to dream? This thought sparked the idea for our prototype. What if a machine could see our drawings—using a camera or any other visual system—and start creating stories by itself? Picture a hat and a frog transforming into the Mad Hatter visiting a witch’s tea store to sample new flavors of tea. Whimsical, isn’t it? For this to happen, machines need to be nurtured with imagination, fantasy, and dreams. They need to interpret a drawing of a hat from different perspectives, each angle adding a layer of rich narrative. It’s about teaching machines not just to see, but to imagine.  Here comes our prototype, a step towards that magical story-installation table from our imagination. It consists of a webcam capturing hand-drawn sketches and recognizing them. The computer runs a recognition system where we can teach what each drawing is, a machine learning system for children’s drawings. Our hands-on investigation is a part of the journey to create that magical scene, where reality blends with fantasy. For this prototype, let’s gather our materials. Grab some paper and start drawing. I used plain white paper folded into a booklet and some cutout drawings. The first ingredient in our creative recipe is a webcam to capture the images. Connect it to a computer and process the images using Teachable Machine. Once the machine has learned from the images, transfer them to MadMapper Home to project them. And voilà! You can trigger different scenes just by showing different drawings. Let’s follow Julio Cortázar’s playful spirit from “Instructions on How to Wind a Watch” and approach our task with a sense of wonder and curiosity. Imagine teaching a machine to weave stories from mere sketches. We draw, the machine learns, and together, we create. Now, let’s end with a provocative twist. Imagine a future where machines learn to tell better stories, developing language, empathy, and imagination. And as we return to our dark room with the antique table, the figure approaching the book is revealed to be a robot. With a delicate motion, it tips its hat, inviting us into a world where the lines between human and machine storytellers blur. Who else is excited to see what stories our machines can tell? Let’s dream together and expand the horizons of our (cyborg?) imaginations. * This video is in Portuguese, but here’s a translation of my delightful conversation with Paulina Cho: Paulina: “I’m recording what you do on a sunny day. ” Lina: “Lina tells the machine a story to sleep…” *What did I learn from this?:  The Power of Playfulness in Learning: Through playful experimentation, I learned that creativity thrives when we approach problems with a sense of wonder and curiosity, much like how children play and learn.  The Importance of Storytelling: Teaching a machine to recognize and create stories from drawings underscored the profound impact of storytelling. It’s a universal language that not only fosters empathy and imagination but also bridges the gap between technology and human experience.  Hands-on Learning with Technology: Engaging directly with tools like Teachable Machine and MadMapper highlighted the significance of hands-on learning. By physically interacting with the technology, I gained a deeper understanding of how machine learning systems work and how they can be applied creatively.  Collaborative Creativity: Working with Diana and integrating her drawings into the project reinforced the importance of collaboration. It showed me that combining different perspectives and skills can lead to richer and more innovative outcomes.  Blending Reality with Fantasy: The process taught me how technology can be used to blur the lines between reality and fantasy, creating immersive and magical experiences. It’s a powerful reminder that the boundaries of our imagination are the only limits to what we can create.  Iterative Process: The development of the prototype reminded me of the importance of iteration. Each trial and error brought new insights and improvements, demonstrating that the journey is just as important as the final outcome.  I need a new notebook: You can hear the processing fan whirring away, and it sounds like it’s about to launch into orbit! 😂 Maybe it’s time to give the machine a rest. Zzz…* Here’s a glimpse of the prototype in action and below you can find a gallery with more photos and videos (Go to Flickr to play the videos, just click on top of the image). Images and videos were made with the incredible help of [[Paulina Cho]]. 🫀🎥  [!warning] No machines were harmed in this episode. "

Ao conhecer o projeto C. O. M. O. (Controle de Operações por Movimento Ocular)*, realizado pelo grupo de pesquisa GIIP**, da UNESP (SP/BR), pude reproduzir a peça vestível “VEST”, projetada e desenvolvida por Rosangella Leote, e que suporta a câmera. A peça é parte do sistema C. O. M. O. , que foi dirigido por Rodrigo Rezende, tendo a parceria de Mau Jabur e Fábio Bueno no desenvolvimento. Além destas pessoas queridas, fizeram parte do projeto Rodrigo Dorta e Andy Barac, na publicação da tecnologia que será aberta, e Daniel Boanerges, na modelagem em computação em 3D da carenagem do robô que é movimentado pelos olhos do usuário. O trabalho deste grupo foi desenvolvido para a nova temporada do programa “Conexão Maker”, programa da TV FUTURA (SP/BR), que é apresentado por Gabi Agustini, gravado em novembro de 2020. Estou muito feliz em ter colaborado com o programa além da oportunidade de realizar meu sonho ao reproduzir o vestível! NOTAS: * O C. O. M. O. é um sistema que, através do movimento ocular, controla objetos e operações computacionais sem fio, desenvolvido preferencialmente para pessoas que não possuem capacidade motora temporária ou permanente, embora possa ser utilizado em outras situações como em dança e outras artes cênicas ou multimidiáticas. O projeto completo está disponível em https://sites. google. com/view/projetocomo/ ** O GIIP - Grupo Internacional e Interinstitucional de Pesquisa em Convergências entre Arte, Ciência e Tecnologia – desenvolve arte com pessoas deficientes desde 2011.

The idea is to rescue the artist who not only produces the art itself, but investigates the materials and tools to reach its end. From the mixture of materials based on algae and mycelium, and with the reinforcement of other organic components, the proposal is to produce an organic thread to be woven manually, based on Japanese handicrafts. This woven yarn comes to life again forming a sculptural organic fabric that moves through space with the help of motors and movement transfer mechanisms. Algae and mushrooms are living things. A living being is an organism that is born, grows, reproduces and dies. To complete each of these steps, it evolves and maintains a metabolism (that is, it produces energy when it eats or breathes). “bioWeb” starts from living organisms and tries to connect the ancestral knowledge of cultivation and the manufacture by technological machines to build a symbiotic bio-inspired network.  Presentation of Development in Tokyo: We believe that part of the “bioWeb” research focused on mycelium can grow a lot within Japan. This is because the importance that mushrooms have for Japanese culture is notorious. It probably started with the abundance of his presence in Japan, due to the country’s temperate climate and high humidity. Ancient Japanese poems comment on mushrooms being used as an exchange item. This ancestral relationship allowed Japan to become an expert in mushroom production. About 400 years ago, during the Edo period, a charcoal producer realized that shiitake mushrooms grew in certain types of wood. Thus began the first process of controlled cultivation of mushrooms in Japan. It was a revolution in the country that has gone through time. The proximity, in Tokyo, between the great technological centers and the rural surroundings, with areas of cultivation and maintenance of traditions with nature, favors research in practical and conceptual terms. What we want with “bioWeb” is to learn from local producers a little of the ancient techniques of mushroom cultivation to obtain the mycelium necessary for the construction of our filament. And so, being able to connect cultures, practices and poetics, locally and globally.

It keeps memory alive with a video mapping craft experience. Narratives, optical effects and representations of a perspective, are all illusions. The mapping experience is a way to explore these elements combined. Normally using digital animation and effects, we forgot that all those elements were explored in the beginning of the cinema and animation, with a lot of manual work. These same hands, are the ones writing the scripts, and the ones drawing and projecting spaces. Our proposal is to explore the hybridity ways of producing moving image, combining paper cut, filming and digital effects to render an homage to paper, architecture and history. Presentation of Development | Collage: Our 30s video is a sample of tests we did to understand how to mix the following techniques: paper cut stop motion, filmed image, digital collage and animation with touches of silent movie effects. It is a pinch of some moments present in the narrative, a sketch. All the images will be re-filmed and re-made with the necessary adjustments for the final projection. The soundtrack is a collage of 2 pianos works from Beethoven with some sound effects. It will be develop to become one entire piece with different rhythms and electronic interferences along the dramaturgy.

    "body": "2020/06/06 - REALEJO - An Exhibition Proposal Through Interactive Art Installations: This prototype is with the partnership of Lídia Ganhito e Liana Yuri 🫀 The exhibition features six lambe-lambe theater boxes (40 x 40 x 40 cm) arranged on different planes (floor, tripod, high, etc. ), a small stage, and a cube with elastic walls. Each of these boxes allows viewers to see its content through a slit. The lambe-lambe theater boxes, the stage, and the elastic wall area are referred to as stations.  Station 04: A small elevated stage (20 cm) stretches two meters along a wall. On the wall, small speakers are attached. Though silent, a projection mapped onto them displays images of silent sounds, onomatopoeias, commands, and old typography. A spotlight sits in the middle of the stage. Anyone attempting to step into the light will find it always turns off. Six school desks are placed in the audience area, provoking thoughts on the constant struggle to be heard and the oppression of being silenced in an information-overloaded world.  Station 12: Next to a bed of nails, there is a mirrored box. Through its slit, one can observe a white feather floating with extreme lightness.  Station 23: This theater features a crank that the viewer can turn to move a crowd. Is it a protest? A celebration? Station 34: Inside this lambe-lambe theater, a motorized mechanism creates an optical illusion. On one side is a cage, on the other, a key. The movement creates a paradox.  Station 42: A typewriter inside the box never stops typing. A roll of paper feeds in and out, constantly rewriting and repeating, generating an excess of content and incomprehensible information.  Station 63: A 2 x 2m cube with elastic walls forces the viewer to navigate the membrane to see inside. Inside, there is a slide projector showing images of doors, locks, and keys.  Station 86: A body outline is marked on the floor. The viewer must position themselves within this outline to see inside the box. Inside, a knife constantly taps on a cell phone.  Station 92: To view this scene, the viewer must stand on a bench and place their head inside the box, where they will see a family sitting on a couch watching them.  Workshops: Pop-Up Techniques Studio: This workshop focuses on creating three-dimensional forms from paper to make pop-up pages, exploring various techniques:  On the first day, we will introduce the group, demonstrate related works, and practice two pop-up techniques: Origami and Kirigami, using simple tools to transform the material and explore its possibilities.  On the second day, we will continue exploring techniques, share the previous day’s works, and create a video featuring participant interactions and testimonials for the exhibition. Electronics for Artistic Creation: This workshop involves creating structures from paper, wire, and wooden sticks, with movements generated by motors and illuminated by LEDs:  Handling and using a soldering iron; Creating electronic circuits with batteries, resistors, LEDs, buttons, motors, and speakers; Using a protoboard for circuit testing; Designing ways to integrate circuits into existing objects and materials such as paper (various weights) and wire. Discussion: Art and Technology: What Can Technical Media Say About Creative Practice?:  An open conversation with the cultural center’s education team and the general public to present study phases, research, aesthetic choices, and the conception and production process; Reflecting on the limitations and possibilities of creative work with technology and how art and technology pathways can contribute to our society. Performance: Realejo Remix:  The original film, in high-contrast shades, includes some scenes colored on the film stock. The digital reinterpretation will use binary information and machine language to stochastically reorganize new images. In the age of machine learning, what can a machine learn and teach about the context of Caligari? These computer-generated images will serve as the basis for video mapping within the exhibition space. Similarly, the audio track will be fragmented and recomposed by algorithms that gather and distort “Caligari” text recordings, creating a sound poem akin to another contemporary artistic practice of the film. A Map for an Illustrated Tour of the Realejo Stations: Explore these interactive art stations that blend technology, creativity, and reflection on our modern world. Join us in this unique journey and experience the intersection of art and innovation. "

However, due to our system’s small scale, we found using a theater smoke machine more effective to create a more immersive environment.  This idea was heavily embraced by our former partner, Luis Leão, known for being my partner in visual experimentation with videomapping and lights. We got inspired to explore the possibility of creating an immersive cloud chamber (a particle detector used to visualize the passage of ions).  This technique, combined with generative projection on smoke and mirrors, allowed us to create a truly unique and engaging visual experience.  "

    "body": "2020/01/22 - Galaxy, a micro-universe in expansion, is an installation of dynamic lights that intends to present the immersive universe of microbiology: This prototype was a partnership with Guilherme Bullejos 🫀 One of the explanations of the biodiversity of the world starts with the idea od complex systems. There are countless elements and groups which make not possible to define explicitly the casual relation between every element or group. However, these systems have simple rules which allow the spountaneous revealing of their emerging characteristics. The evolving theory points to the primordial soup which had given origin to a nitrogenous basis and single-cell organisms at a certain point. As a serendipity choreography, some of those single-cell organisms gave origin to life. Galaxy is an entertaining and optimismtic installation that intends to highlight the force and intelligence that biology can offer when its elements decide to contribute and work together. Public Experience: In this entertaining installation, the visitors are involved by the effect of lighting changing the space’s perception. The visitors are invited to immerse in this space and experience the dynamicity of the microbiology universe by the changing of scale and perspective of the intern representation of its complex systems. The game of lights and shadow populate the space transforming it in a 3d representation of the microbiology universe dynamic. The spectacle of the moving lights around the whole installation brings to the visitors’ reflections about the processes that allowed all beings to be alive and evolve. Schedule: PROTOTYPE 1:2A metal structure with DMX protocolMAY 2020 The second prototype in the 1: 2 scale will be responsible for directing many important decisions. First, regarding the light source and communication protocol. The prototype will be made with 18 CAN64 DMX RGBW reflectors, but we are studying the possibility of making our own reflectors to have control of consumption / power and lenses to direct the objective of the effect we intend to achieve. Another point is the structure, we like the idea of working with treated metal and in general, in Brazil, we use a lot of material for reusing event scenography. The idea is to reuse metals from previous installations. About what we are called a filter, which will help in the effects, we are thinking about using recycled plastic. Thus, we were able to create a moisture resistant module. FINAL PIECE PRODUCTIONChinaAGO 2020 There is a possibility to produce the electronic part of the final part with our suppliers in China. Case that needs to be studied even during the tests of the 1: 2 prototype. The production of the filter made from recycled plastic will be done in Brazil, but the metal structure can be made locally. PRESENTATIONMaybe at some Light Festival…NOV 2020 It is necessary to study the assembly schedule and start in advance given the dimension of the part (6 meters !!). It is also necessary to provide a time for testing the stress of the final piece ready and running a few days before the Festival. Then, it just opens the champagne !! "

These artistic photographs evoke a cinematic imagination of women in film. My generation often associates cinema with adventure, action, and culture, particularly imagining European cinema as atmospheric and pictorial. Interestingly, these textures and the analog film give a French or British composition feel. Reflecting on Lina from the past, who took these photos in 2006, I find it notable that she don’t sexualize the female body. Instead, they pay homage to cinematic language. It’s about understanding and respecting this aesthetic tradition.  "

I am going through my old college files from around 2006, when I was about 20 years old. At that time, I was heavily influenced by David Hockney and his work. Hockney, known for his collage photography, inspired me to undertake an analog black and white photography project. For this project, I took multiple photos of the same action. Perhaps it was my background in film studies or my interest in narrative that led me to this idea. I invited two friends to sit at a table while I planned to cut a piece of raw meat. The concept was for them to offer the raw meat to one of them, who would then cut it with a knife and fork, pretending to eat it. Meanwhile, the conversation and interaction would continue as if it was part of a narrative. I aimed to capture each segment of this action in a series of photos, creating a story-like sequence.  "
